# BEEmod Contributing Guidelines
Welcome to the BEE2.4 issue tracker! If you found a bug in BEE2.4 or want to suggest a new feature, you've come to the right place. That being said, however, don't just go open your issue immediately. To keep the issue tracker organized, we have some guidelines you should follow when opening issues.

### Be polite and listen to staff.
Remember to respect, be kind and polite towards contributors and other users. Being rude or using excessive swearing/offensive/pejorative language will make it less likely that you get help, might get your issue locked, and in more extreme cases, your account banned. Contributors are here to help however and whenever they can. Demanding solutions or tagging them will not get the job done any quicker, and will only cause inconveniences.

### This is not a forum.
The issue tracker is for keeping track of bugs and feature requests; it is not a discussion forum. Please don't open an issue to ask a question, tell us about something, or even just to chat with people. **Do post off topic comments or questions on issues**. These things should instead be done on our [Discussion Page](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/discussions) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hnGFJrz). If you have a question, you should also check the [FAQ](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/blob/master/FAQ.md) first.

Non-serious discussion is not allowed. If your post is not necessary for the discussion of the issue, it will be hidden. Repeat offenders will be punished.

### Know what you are talking about.
If you are not part of the team or a contributor, we kindly ask that you do not try to help with other people's issues. It's fine to lend a hand if you have experience and know what's going on; however, in most circumstances you should leave it to the development team. We'd like to avoid confusion.

### Post on the correct repository.
There are three main BEEmod repositories. 

* [BEE2-items](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/issues) is for issues related to items, styles, and the other content from the packages.
* [BEE2-music](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-music/issues) is for music related issues.
* [BEE2.4](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/issues) is for issues related to the application and compiler.

If you accidentally open an issue on the wrong repository, we can transfer it over. However, it's better to open it on the correct repository to begin with.

### Check for an existing/duplicate issue.
We don't need multiple issues open about the same bug or feature. Before posting anything, please make sure the issue is not on the [Known Issues](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/Known-Issues) wiki page; even if it isn't, perform a search to make sure it hasn't already been reported. **Try searching with simple keywords such as names or words in an error log**. Duplicate issues are unnecessary and will immediately be closed, no matter how severe an issue it may be. Do not intentionally open a duplicate issue to remind us about a bug/feature. Comments exist for a reason.

### Do not duplicate/reopen your issues.
If you've already posted an issue or your issue was closed, do not make another issue with the same subject or reopen it. If you issue is closed, this is a decision made by the development team. Don't post comments about it, if you have questions about a decision then head over to a place of discussion.

### Do not close an issue marked as done.
If an issue is marked as done, that means it will be closed automatically in the next release. Issues should remain open until then so that people know that they are still active problems with the current release of the app.

### Test bugs in the latest version of BEE2.
**Do not open an issue if you are not running the latest version**. Bugs should always be tested in the latest version of BEE2 or an up-to-date development build to ensure that they still apply. Reporting bugs using an old version of the mod causes confusion as every bug listed may not actually be a current issue.

You are free to use any version of BEE2 for any reason, but we will not provide support if you choose to use an old version.

### Provide as much information as possible.
When reporting a bug, provide a screenshot or video of it. If you're getting an error, include the crash or compile log. If you have experience with Python (for the app) or Hammer (for the items), you can be even more helpful by trying to debug the issue yourself. If someone provides a solution to the issue or asks for more detail, please respond.

This applies to feature requests as well; describe in detail what the feature is, how it should function, what properties an item should have, etc. The more information you provide, the faster we'll be able to fix/implement something. We will close issues if we are unable to fix them because we don't have enough information.

If you post an issue you are expected to reply to organization members. Issues with little to no information are useless to us and will be closed after a few hours.

### Don't combine issues.
While it might seem efficient to put all of your bugs/suggestions in one post, this has several drawbacks. Each item can't be individually labelled, or closed once it is fixed/implemented. If you have multiple unrelated bug reports or feature requests, please create separate issues instead of combining them. The issues can then be automatically closed when an update that fixes them is released. There are a few exceptions to this rule - for example, if you're reporting multiple bugs with one specific item, it's usually okay, though separate issues are probably still preferred.

### Item and style suggestions
BEEmod cannot modify the game code, and is not a Hammer replacement. Keep these points in mind when suggesting a new item or style:

- Things should already be present in Portal 1/2 or a existing mod/map: This keeps content to things which actually fit in the game, and are possible in the engine.
- No beta content: Most of these resources aren't publicly available, and it's a very unfinished and incoherent mess of parts.
- No, we won't develop your custom style for you. Styles require a lot of work and maintenance.
- Focus on puzzle potential: In general, items should be focused on providing new opportunities for puzzles, not solely for decoration purposes.
- Versatility is key: For the most part, good new items maximise their flexibility in different situations, especially in improving the puzzle experience. We're not adding some item that only works for your specific map.
- While not a requirement, don't waste your time trying to come up with overcompilcated "technical names" for custom test elements. Nobody actually uses these.

Keep in mind that BEEmod's content is not hardcoded or locked down in any way. Even if we say no to your suggestion, you or someone else can still implement it as a custom package.

### Other requirements
A User must be at least 13 years of age as per the [GitHub account requirement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#b-account-terms).

**Repeatedly failing to follow these guidelines may result in your account being banned from the BEE2.4 GitHub repositories.** Ban evasion is not acceptable, and will get your multiple accounts reported and most likely removed. <!--YOU FOOL, I HAVE 70 ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTS!-->
