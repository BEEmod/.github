## Portal 2  Mod Tool
The BEE2 allows reconfiguring Portal 2's Puzzlemaker editor to use additional items, reskin maps for
different eras, and configure many other aspects. All vanilla items have been upgraded with additional
bugfixes and improvements.

## Download and Use
- Download the latest releases of the BEE2.4 and items from the following pages:
  - [Application](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/releases)
  - [Item Packages](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/releases)
- Extract the contents of the Application release anywhere you like. _e.g. `C:\BEE2.4`_
  - *Do not put BEE in your Portal 2 installation folder*
- Place extracted package folder in the root BEE2 folder. _e.g. `C:\BEE2.4\packages`_
- To run, locate the BEE2 application in the app folder and execute it. _e.g. `C:\BEE2.4\BEE2.exe`_

As of version 4.37 we have stopped supporting BEE2.4 on Mac. See [this wiki article](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/wiki/BEE2.4-on-Mac) for more details and how you can still use the mod.
